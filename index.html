               <p>This book is about a mysterious sketch, living in a museum after hours, and most importantly a file cabinet full of index cards and article clippings guarded by a grumpy old woman: who knows what intriguing tidbits are hidden inside?</p>

               <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Penumbra%27s_24-Hour_Bookstore" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</a></h2>
               <blockquote>
                    Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore combines elements of fantasy, mystery, friendship and adventure as a way of looking at the modern conflict and transition between new technology (electronic) and old (print books). The protagonist is a laid-off Silicon Valley tech worker who begins working at a dusty bookstore with very few customers, only to start discovering one secret after another. The mysterious old books, along with the store's owner, lead to a 500-year-old secret society.

               <p>This book is a force of mysterious knowledge: wandering the stacks of the Bodleain Library, a young boy encounters a book clasped by two serpents. Mysticisim, knowledge, and Faust are all part of the journey that commences.</p>

               <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Westing_Game" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">The Westing Game</a></h2>
               <p>Can you solve the mystery of the will before the author reveals it to you? Not just a tonally mysterious book, but a puzzling one too. A classic of children's literature.</p>

               <img src="images/#" alt="cover image of Chasing Vermeer" />
               <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_Vermeer" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Chasing Vermeer</a></h2>
               <p>One of the few books in this list that inspired me to take notes while reading it, feeling like I could solve the mystery myself, right alongside the characters. A wonderful description of place, set in the ornate University of Chicago neighboorhood and in the bustling city of Chicago. If you've never seen a Vermeer painting, this book will make you want to find one to observe.</p>
               <p>The sequels are excellent and equally as mysterious.</p>

               <p>Specifically, the first book and its symbol cipher along the bottom of each page in the book. I learned to write it, found a symbol key, and began to decipher it &mdash; to the point where I could almost <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vAnuBtyEYE" target="_blank" title="YouTube - The Matrix">read the symbols</a> as letters. I never did decipher all the ciphered text in the book though.</p>

               <h2><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Top_Secret.html?id=_HjRUYwJ1moC" target="_blank" title="Top Secret - Google Books">Top Secret: A Handbook of Codes &amp; Ciphers</a></h2>
               <p>I was so obsessed with this book that I didn't want to return it to the library. I created my own copy with all the bits I found most interesting by copying them onto lined paper by hand, adding a hand-drawn cover, and stapling it all together to create my own mini-booklet.</p>

               <p>This book was a hand-me-down from my Cool Aunt. I loved that this was written in a straight-forward and matter-of-fact tone &mdash; like a real handbook might have been. I have vague memories of assembling a detective/spy kit, and this book was included. The colorful and fun pictures are a strong point, though not very mysterious in-and-of themselves.</p>
